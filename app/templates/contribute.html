	<h2>What kinds of observations can you contribute?</h2>
	<p>ReefGauge is focused on observations that help divers and scientists understand how healthy a reef is. This means that your observation should be a clear picture of coral, an herbivorous fish, a piscivorous fish, or a bethic organism like macroalgae or crustose coralline algae. Check out the Reef Groups in the ReefGauge community tab to see all the accepted species.</p>
	<p>At the moment, ReefGauge is focused on data and observations for the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Atlantic. Make sure your observations fall within this geographic range.</p>
