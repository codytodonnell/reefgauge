			<h1>ReefGauge</h1>
			<p>Coral reefs are one of the worldâ€™s most complex, mesmerizing, and fragile environments. Understanding and protecting them requires collective knowledge from both the scientific community and the community of divers and ocean advocates. ReefGauge is a learning tool that blends knowledge from these communities together to empower all of us to be ambassadors for coral reefs.</p>

			<h1>Contribute Your Observations</h1>
			<p>ReefGauge fuels its community data through a partnering project on the non-profit citizen science platform <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/" target="_blank">iNaturalist</a>. Be a part of the solution, contextualize the science, and help the community see what's going on underwater.</p>
			<h2>Getting Started</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Set up an account on iNaturalist. It's free, easy, and non-commercial.</li>
				<li>Check out the <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/reefgauge" target="_blank">ReefGauge iNaturalist project page</a>.</li>
				<li>Start uploading your observations!</li>
			</ol>
			<h2>What kinds of observations can you contribute?</h2>
			<p>ReefGauge is focused on observations that help divers and scientists understand how healthy a reef is. This means that your observation should be a clear picture of coral, an herbivorous fish, a piscivorous fish, or a bethic organism like macroalgae or crustose coralline algae. Check out the Reef Groups in the ReefGauge community tab to see all the accepted species.</p>
			<p>At the moment, ReefGauge is focused on data and observations for the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and Western Atlantic. Make sure your observations fall within this geographic range.</p>
